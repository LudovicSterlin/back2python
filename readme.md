## Back to Python

You will need a working Python environment. Anaconda is recommended.

To download the materials:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/xoolive/edu_back2python
cd edu_back2python
```

Unpack the compressed data file. If you want to stick to the command line, in the `data` directory:
```sh
7zr x data/02-prix2016.csv.7z -odata
```

You can then start the first notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

All solutions are provided so you could go through all this in 15 minutes.

But since we have enough time, you are encouraged to really try the exercises before loading the solutions. We are here to help!
