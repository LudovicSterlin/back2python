    "# Puzzle solving using an Object-Oriented interface\n",
    "\n",
    "*Inspired by Raymond Hettinger's talk at PyCon 2019*\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of puzzles can be solved by either depth first search or breadth first search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present a generic puzzle solver that works on a broad class of puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is that we need very few things to describe the puzzle in a way that a solver can find a solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need an initial position (the unsolved puzzle)\n",
    "2. We need a rule (typically an iterator) to generate all possible moves from a position.\n",
    "3. We need to recognize the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, we can provide some extras:\n",
    "1. a `__repr__` method to display the puzzle position in a way recognizable to us.\n",
    "2. a `isgoal()` method to recognize the goal state, by default set to `self.goal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following puzzle is solved for you: note the `__iter__` method using the `yield` keyword to generate neighbouring positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <b>Exercice:</b> Two puzzles are given for you to solve: the n-queens problem and the Solitaire problem.<br/>\n",
    "Write the corresponding method so that the solve() method does the tree-search for you.\n",
    "</div>    \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "    <b>Information:</b> By default, a breadth-first search is called, which is the safest option when the shortest path solution needs to be found or when some paths have a potential to wander around infinitely (i.e. you can randomly twist a Rubik's cube all day and never come near a solution).<br/>\n",
    "    You may want to switch to depth-first search for the two other puzzles with option <code>solve(depthFirst=True)</code>.\n",
    "</div>    \n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an `IndexError: pop from an empty deque` exception, this means you finished exploring the search without finding a solution: check your `isgoal()` function and that you did not miss anything during the iteration."
